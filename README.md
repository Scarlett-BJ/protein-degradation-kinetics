# Halflife

Scripts used to generate selected figures from McShane, E. et al. Kinetic Analysis of Protein Stability Reveals Age-Dependent Degradation. Cell 167, 803â€“815 (2016).

Lots of other behind the scenes analyses included in python src files. Apologies for any dependencies that I haven't included.

to run unit tests:
`$ cd halflife/halflife`
`$ py.test ..`
